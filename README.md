quicksortjs
===========

Hey, this is an implementation of quicksort on numbers in javascript that I made to work on algorithms and to practice testing in javascript. I am reasonably sure that I am complying with the license (MIT) of jasmine but can remove lib/ if I am in violation after all.

Currently, my code does not work on arrays with duplicate elements.

Using the function:

return type - Javascript array []

args - a Javascript array of numbers, ex [1,3,4,5,6]
